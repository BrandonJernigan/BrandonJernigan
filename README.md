#Hi, I'm Brandon.
### About Me
I am passionate about software development in all forms. I love learning new languages and tools to aide me in my journey of learning this crazy awesome art. It is my dream to become a full stack software developer, and no matter what, I plan to accomplish this goal. So join me on my software adventure and find out more below.

### Website
Below is a link to my portfolio website. It is a full stack project that I use to share my web applications. Not all of the projects on this page will have public repositories, but most do.

### Github Layout
The projects on my GitHub are open source projects of all disciplines. I like to experiment with other types of projects using a variety of languages. These projects are scratch projects where the code is not always pretty, the functionality is not always complete, but they have taught me a valuable skill, allowed me to explore a programming language, or were just fun projects that I enjoyed creating for no other reason. Below is a link to a simple webpage project hosted on GitHub pages that I use to display my GitHub projects in more of a visual format... Really, I just wanted to have a project use GitHub pages and needed a project to allow me to do this. With all of that in mind, I hope you find what you are looking for on here, and feel free to connect with me through LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter.
